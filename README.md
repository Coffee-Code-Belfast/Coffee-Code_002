# Coffee&amp;Code#002: ToDo List - JavaScript &amp; Vue.js (authors Caroline Chan and Ciara Magee)

## Today’s challenge:
We are going to be creating a To Do List application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There is also the option (please see below Level 2) to build the To Do List in Vue.js if you’d like to try it.

Remember: if you are stuck, ask a mentor for help!

## Setup 
We are going to be using codesandbox.io: an online editor that can be used to create and deploy web applications. 
You can sign in to codesandbox.io using a github account. If you do not currently have one, you can create one here: Create a GitHub account
When you are logged into codesandbox.io, create a static sandbox.


## To Do List: Minimum Viable Product
What is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product)? This is a term commonly used when working on a product / development team. An MVP is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers. 

In order to be a minimum viable product, the To Do List application should meet the following requirements:
As a user, I want to be able to see the items on my to do list.
As a user, I want to be able to add items to my to do list.
As a user, I want to be able to remove items from my to do list.
As a user, I want to be able check an item off in my to do list when I have completed it.

Feel free to implement any additional features as if you would like to!

A step by guide is available here: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_todolist.asp You can try changing up the CSS to make it look better!



## Level 2:


## Description
As an additional challenge you can also try creating the To Do List application using Vue.js. Use the same requirements as the challenge in Level 1. 

## What is Vue?
Vue is a JavaScript framework that can be used to create user interface: https://vuejs.org/ 

## Setup
We are going to be using codesandbox.io: an online editor that can be used to create and deploy web applications
You can sign in to codesandbox.io using a github account. If you do not currently have one, you can create one here: Create a GitHub account
When you are logged into codesandbox.io, create a Vue sandbox.

## Starting Points
What do you want a to do list item to look like?  Vue is really cool and will allow us to write code - called a component -  for a to do list item that can be used for every item in our todo list. 
Vue uses a HTML based template syntax that allows you to bind the rendered DOM to the Vue instance data underneath.
What is the DOM? https://css-tricks.com/dom/. The Document Object Model represents a page, so programs can change the structure, style, and content of the document.
